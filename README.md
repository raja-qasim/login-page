# My First Login Page

This is my first login page built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  

- All styling is written **inside `<style>` tags**.  
- This project was uploaded on **GitHub** while I was learning **Git** and **GitHub** for the first time.  

It’s a simple project made to practice **HTML structure, CSS styling, and using GitHub for version control**.
